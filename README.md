### Fragmenting Genome Sequences by Coding Regions to Improve Performance of the AmpliDiff Algorithm for Large Genomes
This repository contains a modified version of AmpliDiff to support scaling to larger genomes.
This repository was created for the Research Project 2023-2024 of TU Delft.

#### Code and datasets
- The pre-processing algorithm can be found in the PreprocessingCodingRegion folder.
- The datasets and parameters used in the abundance estimation can be found in the Datasets folder.

##### The AmpliDiff README is renamed to README_AmpliDiff.md
